                    I enjoy systems and infrastructure, and I've been happy
                    to work directly on some of the largest scale systems on earth.

                    I recently worked at <em class="discord">Discord</em> on
                    media infrastructure, where I helped grow the team while
                    reducing storage costs, slowing the spread of malware across the
                    internet, responding to gif encoding ddos attacks, and
                    modernizing legacy infra.

                    Prior to that, I worked at <em class="meta">Meta</em> for 6+
                    years in video and ads infrastructure. Some of the most interesting projects included
                    <ul>
                        <li>scaling a timeseries database >10x</li>
                        <li>
                            parallelizing video encoding (both live and vod) to be much faster for

                        <li>

                    I studied math and CS at the university of Waterloo, where I was in the co-op program.
                    It led me to 6 jobs throughout my degree, on almost every layer
                    in the stack: Lua, Python, JS, C++, Android and PHP/Hack.
